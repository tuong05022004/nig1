# 👋 Hi, I’m Tuong (@tuong05022004)

## 👀 About Me
I’m interested in building modern and efficient web applications using a variety of technologies. My main focus areas are **Java** for backend development and **CSS** for creating beautiful, responsive front-end designs. I also enjoy experimenting with new frameworks and tools to enhance my development workflow.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I’m currently diving deeper into:
- **Advanced Java**: Improving my skills in Java Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and microservices architecture.
- **CSS Frameworks**: Mastering CSS with libraries like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and SASS to create scalable and maintainable styles.
- **JavaScript**: Learning more about front-end frameworks like React.js to complement my CSS skills.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On
I’m eager to collaborate on:
- Web development projects that involve both Java backend and responsive CSS-driven frontends.
- Open-source Java projects, particularly in areas such as backend services, APIs, and system integrations.
- Projects that focus on user experience (UX) and UI design to create intuitive and elegant interfaces.
